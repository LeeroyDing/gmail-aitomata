Implemented feature request #18: Added a confidence score to the AI's task creation analysis. This involved modifying `AIAnalyzer.ts` to include a `confidence` object in the `PlanOfAction` interface, updating the AI prompt and response schema, and modifying `Processor.ts` to log and add the confidence information to task notes. A new test case was added to `Processor.test.ts` to verify this functionality. All tests passed. Changes were committed to a new branch `feat/issue-18` and a pull request was created.
