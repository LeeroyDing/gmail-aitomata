**Summary of Current State:**

I have successfully resolved the Todoist API error. This involved:

1.  Diagnosing the root cause of the "Failed to get a plan from the AI" error by adding enhanced logging.
2.  Identifying that the Todoist API was returning a "400 Bad Request" due to an incorrect `due_date` format.
3.  Fixing the `due_date` format in `TodoistManager.ts` and adding more robust error logging.
4.  Creating a pull request with the fix, which was then merged after all checks passed.
5.  Cleaning up the local and remote branches and updating the local `main` branch.
