**Summary of Current State:**

I have successfully implemented batch email processing to address issue #4. This involved:

1.  Creating a new `generatePlans` method in `AIAnalyzer.ts` to handle multiple threads in a single API call.
2.  Updating `Processor.ts` to use the new batching functionality.
3.  Updating all relevant tests in `AIAnalyzer.test.ts` and `Processor.test.ts` to reflect the changes.
4.  Committing the changes to the `fix/issue-4` branch.
5.  Creating a pull request for the changes.

I have also saved a detailed development workflow protocol to my memory, which I will follow in all future tasks.
