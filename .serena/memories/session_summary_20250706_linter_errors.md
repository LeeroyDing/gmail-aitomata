**Summary of Current State:**

I have been working on issue #1, which is to create a linter. I have:

1.  Checked out the `1-fr-create-linter` branch.
2.  Installed the new dependencies.
3.  Attempted to fix the linter errors, but got stuck.
4.  Committed the current changes to the branch.

The next step is to fix the remaining linter errors.
