**Summary of Current State:**

I have successfully merged the pull request for issue #5. This involved:

1.  Verifying that all checks for pull request #11 had passed.
2.  Merging the pull request using the `--squash` flag.
3.  Deleting the local and remote `fix/issue-5` branches.
4.  Updating the local `main` branch to be in sync with the remote repository.

Additionally, I created a new memory file, `git_non_interactive_editor_protocol.md`, to remember how to handle Git operations that require a text editor.
