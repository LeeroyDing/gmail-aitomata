### **Part 3: Lessons Learned from Test Failures**

The process of fixing the unit tests has highlighted several key points about the project's architecture and the testing environment:

1.  **Strict Typing is Enforced:** The TypeScript compiler is strictly enforcing the types defined in the Google Apps Script type definitions. This means that mock objects used in tests must be complete and accurate representations of the objects they are mocking.
2.  **Global Namespace Pollution is a Problem:** The original tests relied on polluting the global namespace with mock objects. This is not a good practice and caused several issues with the Jest test environment. The refactored tests now use Jest's mocking features to avoid this problem.
3.  **Test Code Should be Separate from Application Code:** The original code mixed test code with application code. This is not a good practice and made it difficult to test the code in isolation. The refactored code now has a clean separation between the application code and the test code.
4.  **Mocks are Essential for Testing:** The tests rely heavily on mock objects to simulate the Google Apps Script environment. The `Mocks.ts` file is a good central location for these mock objects.
5.  **Jest is a Powerful Tool:** Jest is a powerful tool for testing JavaScript and TypeScript code. It provides a rich set of features for mocking, assertion, and test running.
