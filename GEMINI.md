# Project: AI-Powered Gmail Automata

## Objective
Evolve the script from a static, rule-based system to an intelligent email assistant using an LLM to manage a to-do list in Google Tasks and organize the inbox.

## Current Status
The script intelligently analyzes incoming emails to determine if they are actionable. For actionable emails, it automatically creates a task in Google Tasks with an AI-generated title and summary. Non-actionable emails are left as unread, ensuring that only relevant items are added to your to-do list.
